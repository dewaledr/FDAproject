# FDAproject
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook showing the details of our investigation into box plots and their uses
A Summary description and history of the box plot is presented followed by a demonstration of the use of the box plot using data of our choosing. We went further to explain common relevant terminology like quartile and percentile, etc...
A basic comparison of the box plot to alternatives, for example histograms and the kernel density estimate (kde) is also presented in this notebook.
